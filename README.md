## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about CSS blend modes using images and backgrounds, improved my knowledge about grid layouts and media queries.

I had a lot of throubles before get in this code:

```html
<div class="hero-box">
  <img
    class="hero-desktop hero"
    src="./images/image-header-desktop.jpg"
    alt="Women working in an office"
  />
  <img
    class="hero-mobile hero"
    src="./images/image-header-mobile.jpg"
    alt="Women working in an office"
  />
</div>
```

```css
.hero-box {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  grid-area: hero;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
}

.hero {
  width: 100%;
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

### Continued development

I have to study more about display and positions.

### Useful resources

- I struggled for a hole until youtube suggested this video on one of my searches:
  - Kevin Powell [How to use mix-blend-mode, and how to avoid problems with it](https://youtu.be/TAA89nkEuhw)
  - The first 3 minutes of the video solved my problem.
